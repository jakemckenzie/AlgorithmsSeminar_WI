\noindent \item Consider the following recurrence:
\begin{numcases}{Z(n)=}
    1, & if $n=1$\\
    3Z(\frac{n}{6}) + n, & $n > 1$
  \end{numcases}
Draw out a visualization of what this recurrences looks like as a tree.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\noindent \item How much work is done on level $i$?
\newpage 
\noindent \item How many recursive levels are there in the tree?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\noindent \item How much work is done at the leaf level?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\newpage
\noindent \item Construct a non-recursive expression equivalent to the recurrence. Your solution may use a summation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\noindent \item Find the big-$\Theta$ bound for the recurrence.

For Brackets(3) the output would be ((())) (()()) (())() ()(()) ()()()
