\item[0. ] Prove the theorem below using the techniques of binding the term and splitting the
sum to find a tight bound for the sum. Make sure your proof is complete, concise, clear
and precise.\\
\textbf{Theorem 0: }
$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^4\in\Theta(n^5)$$

\item Prove the theorem below using the techniques of binding the term and splitting the
sum to find a tight bound for the sum. Make sure your proof is complete, concise, clear
and precise.\\
\textbf{Theorem 1: }
$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(\log_2{i})^2\in\Theta(n(\log_2{n})^2)$$

Here is an algorithm for singing that annoying song ``99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall''.
It exhibits all the qualities we expect from algorithms, namely that it is explicit, 
precise, unambiguous, mechanically-executable sequence of elementary instructions intended to 
accomplish a specific purpose.\\

\item If you use this algorithm to sing this terrible song, $n$-times how many times will you say beer? $2n$? 
\newpage
Here is an algorithm for singing a far less annoying song, $12$ Days of Christmas, generalized to $n$ 
Days of Christmas. Instead of analyzing the exact \st{running} singing time, let focus on the asymptotic behavior. \\

\item How many gifts are sent into this algorithm? Express this as an exact answer.
\item Express the \st{running} singing time as a sum, then big theta running time ( 
\textbf{HINT: }The singer mentions the name of a gift how many times?).
\item During the first $n$ days of Christmas, my true love gate to me exactly how many gifts? Express 
this as a sum, then solve that sum finding the the big theta space complexity of the number of gifts my true love gave to me.
